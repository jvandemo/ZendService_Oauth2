# HTTP ClientZendService Oauth2 contains it's own HTTP client and HTTP client interface.This allows you to write your own custom HTTP client and provide a mock client for testing.## Default HTTP clientIf no HTTP client is set explicitly, ZendService Oauth2 will delegate all HTTP requeststo Zend\Http\ClientStatic.## Custom HTTP clientTo use your own custom HTTP client, create a new class that implements`ZendService\Oauth2\Http\Client\ClientInterface` and let the Oauth2 client use it:```$client = new \ZendService\Oauth2\Client\Client;$client->setHttpClient(new YourCustomHttpClient());```
